## When to use Redux

- You have larger amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
- The app state is updated frequently over time
- The logic to update that state may be complex
- The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people
- You want to be able to understand when, why, and how the state in your application has updated, and visualize the changes to your state over time
- You need more powerful capabilities for managing side effects, persistence, and data serialization
